configure the count property in the "src/config.js" 
file to the desired number of iterations you want per folders
note  some times you may need to provide high number for the iterations to occur

a) "npm run start"  this sort the images with respect to the count provided, then place them in a folder for iteration
b) "npm run build"  this goes into the new structured folder and pick images from different folders to create a single images


note if you get an error while running "npm run build" it just mean the npm run start picked images that are not surficient enough to give the final output
so run (a) and (b) again
